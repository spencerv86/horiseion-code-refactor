# Horiseon-Code-Refactor

## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to enhance the accessibility of the client's page to ensure that the greatest percentage of people are able to use the site, as well as improve the overall readability of the code and stylesheet.

Although the original code was mostly functional, it had a couple broken links and multiple redundancies in the stylesheet. The HTML was also lacking any alt text for it's images and semantic elements, as well as a proper title. The stylesheet was poorly organized and was inconsistent in it's use of ids, classes, and basic selectors. To clean this up, I moved elements around in the stylesheet so that they followed along the HTML code sequentially. I also condensed multiple redundant elements down into one class selector that could cover all of the referenced code.

For clarity, I removed all div tags in the HTML file and replaced them with more descriptive semantic elements. I added line breaks and tabs to increase readability. I added a detailed title and illustrative alt tags to all images, and fixed a broken link where the destination for the 'Search Engine Optimization' nav-link was improperly IDed.
